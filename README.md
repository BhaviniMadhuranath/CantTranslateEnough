# CantTranslateEnough
NLP (UE20CS342) project -  A multilingual language identifier and translator 


### Observations
- higher the N-gram number, the more accurate the translation is since european languages have many similar words and sentence structures
- langages with similar scripts will be used since they are easier to implement using similarity distances
